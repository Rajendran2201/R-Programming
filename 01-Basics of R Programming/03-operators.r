# There are different types of operators in R namely 
# Assignment, Arithmetic, Relational and logical 


# 1. Assignment Operators - three types 

print("Assignment Operators : ")

a = 5 
b <- 23
54 -> c
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

# 2. Arithmetic operators -> +, - , *, /

print("Arithmetic Operators : ")

num1 = 10 
num2 = 20

print(num1+num2)
print(num1-num2)
print(num1*num2)
print(num1/num2)

# 3. Relational Operators -> >, < , ==, != 

print("Relational Operators : ")

n1 = 20 
n2 <- 43

print(n1<n2)

# 4. Logical Operators 

print("Logical Operators : ")

log1 = TRUE 
log2 = FALSE

print(log1 & log2)
print(log1 | log2 )
